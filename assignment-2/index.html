                    <p>Kalpana Chawla was the first Indian-born woman
                         and the second Indian person to fly in space,
                        following cosmonaut Rakesh Sharma who flew in 1984 
                        in a spacecraft. On her first mission, Chawla
                        traveled over 10.4 million miles in 252
                         orbits of the earth, logging more than 372 hours in
                        space.</p>

                    <summary>About first mission of chawla ?</summary>
                    <p>Her first space mission began on 19 November 1997, as part of the six-astronaut crew that flew
                        the Space Shuttle Columbia flight STS-87.Chawla was the first Indian woman to go in space. She
                        spoke the following words while traveling in the weightlessness of space, "You are just your
                        intelligence." She had traveled 10.67 million km, as many as 252 times around the Earth.On her
                        first mission, Chawla traveled 10.4/6.5 million miles in 252 orbits of the earth, logging more
                        than 376 hours (15 days and 16 hours) in space.
                        During STS-87, she was responsible for deploying the Spartan Satellite which malfunctioned,
                        necessitating a spacewalk by Winston Scott and Takao Doi to capture the satellite. A five-month
                        NASA investigation exonerated[citation needed] Chawla by identifying errors in software
                        interfaces and the defined procedures of the flight crew and ground control. After the
                        completion of STS-87 post-flight activities, Chawla was assigned to technical positions in the
                        astronaut office to work on the space station.

                    <p>Her second flight was on STS-107, the final flight of Space Shuttle Columbia in 2003. Chawla was
                        one of the seven crew members who died in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster when the
                        spacecraft disintegrated during its re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere on 1 February 2003.</p>
